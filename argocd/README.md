# Automation of Everything - How To Combine Argo Events, Workflows & Pipelines, CD, and Rollouts

From the video [Automation of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNXJtxkUKeY&list=PLyicRj904Z9-P2QeEAZDy7fgWlQI4tin5&index=2&t=10s)

What do we get if we combine events, workflows, GitOps, progressive delivery, and secrets management? The short answer is that we get automation of everything in Kubernetes in a way that we should be operating in 2021.

We'll combine Argo Events, Workflows & Pipelines, CD, and Rollouts and sprinkle all that with SealedSecrets, Kaniko, and a few other tools.
